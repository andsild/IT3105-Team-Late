\begin{abstract}
    This text answers assignment 1: Implementing and Testing the A* algorithm.
    The A*-method is intended to be written general enough to be used in later
    projects. This text elabortes on the choises made and the working of A*.
\end{abstract}

% \begin{IEEEkeywords}

\IEEEPARstart{A*}{} is a local search algorithm. It is similar to DFS and BFS,
except that when choosing a new node, it always chooses a node based on an 
index value, rather than considering the time of which the node was spotted.
The index value is supposed to estimate how far away from a given goal
the current state is, and also how far away from start the state is.
Thus, higher index values are not preferred. Each iteration in an A*-search is referred to as a state. 

\section{Method}
Since A* always chooses either the lowest or highest cost for a node, we
implemented the A*-agenda with a minimum-heap. Heaps have the property that the root
node has a consistenly higher or a lower value than all of its children.
Thus, the next state on the agenda is the one with the lowest objective value,
and hopefully nearest the goal. Also,
insertions are $\log{n}$, so heaps for agendas are quite fast (at least compared
to regular lists that cost at least $n \log{n}$ for sorting).

A problem that is solvable in A* must have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iterative, such that a problem during solving can be stored in a state
    \item An ability to find an objective value for a state
    \item An ability to generate (multiple) successors from a state
    \item Assessing whether or not a state is at the goal
\end{itemize}
Notably, all of these properties are related mostly to the problem itself, not
the A*-method. Therefore, we wrote a single A*-method without the notion of class.
Its reqirement is that its input is an agenda with states, and a method
to assess these states. Since a lot of states are generated, we did not want
to store all the information in the states. Therefore we also implemented
a class ``Problem'' that has the ability to assess states and generate successors.

While python does not have the strict notion of abstract classes, we created
``Problem'' and ``State'' as abstract superclasses. Then,
to create a problem, you need to create one subclasses for each, and implement
the abstract methods. This can be done without consulting the code for A*,
just consulting the docstring for the abstract methods. Hence we would like
to claim that our A*-method is general.

~\autoref{fig:UMLproblem} shows the ``Problem class'':
\begin{description}
    \item[network] is a reference to the (currently) cartesian
    plane of vertices and edges. 
    \item[Destructor] is invoked after the queue of states is exhausted (clean-up and animation).
        We included this since some animations will e.g.\ paint the goal node as
        a part of a path rather than a final state, etc.
    \item[genNeighbour()] will genereate all possible successor states
        from the current state
    \item[triggerstart] generates a starting state to be used in A*
    \item[updateStates] paints and animates the canvas (animation-logic). 
        We wanted to include this method in this class because we felt the
        animation-logic varies from problem to problem.
\end{description}

\label{fig:UMLproblem}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:UMLstate}, there is the ``State'' class:
\begin{description}
    \item[func,funcargs:] is the objective function and the arguments
        to be used in the function. Its currently the same in every state,
        but now the program can be modified such that in the future, a state
        and its predecessors can change function when propagating and updating
        old states.
    \item[betterThanOther] is the function equivalent of the \textless{} operator,
        used to compare states. It is used to compare two states with
        similar values. If one state has a shorter or longer ancestor tree than the
        other, ``betterthanother'' returns true or false, respectively.
\end{description}


\section{A*}
Our A*-implementation is intended to be the same as in the assignment text.
Below is our attempt at an explanation. By \textit{index} we mean that two states
are similar except that their ancestor tree is different.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item pop the currently most promising state.
    \item generate all possbile successor states
    \item assign an objective value to each successor
    \item if a successor state has a similar index as a previously generate state:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item if the successor state is better:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item set the remembered state to this index such that future
                        discoveries point to this successor
                    \item propagate back along the ancestor tree of the old state,
                        and ensure that if using the new states' path to get 
                        to an ancestor is better, this will be preffered in the 
                        future.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% All states need a method to be indexed. This index should be similar between
% states at the same point. This means that the heuristic function returns the same
% value. The objective function, however, usually measured as the depth, can be
% different. In general we want the shortest path, so whenever two states
% have the same index, the one with the shortes ancestor tree is remembered
% as the state for the index, and the other is forgotten.
% In our case, the index value (assumed to be an integer) is stored in a dictionary.
% The lookup, and insertions are $O(1)$.
%
Since each successor will need to have an objective value, we use the objective
function \textit{attach-and-eval} whenever generating a successor. Similar to 
the A*-code given in the assignment text, we do not actually evaluate the 
state until it is popped off the queue.

\section{Generating successor states}
In a classical problem like search, we cannot generate completely random
states. This would essentially be forking the problem in two: instead of only
looking for the goal, we are now also looking for a path to the start.
Other situations, does not necessarily require that you find an optimal path,
e.g.\ the 8-queens puzzle. Here, you could make random choices and easilier
find a valid solution.

Since the generation of successor states seems to depend on the problem, we
opted with saying that the implementation of \textit{genSuccessors} should be done
for each problem. We could say that an A* search should just reason 
with its states and ``state-children'', but we felt this would clutter
more than help.

To keep it general, the generation of successor states is kept



\section{Comparison of heuristic functions}
In this assignment, we were supposed to find the shortest path
from a point $S$ to a point $D$ on 2D-grid. This topic is widely discussed in other
literature, so I will not elaborate.

A common heuristic function is the \textit{manhattan distance}, which measures the 
distance from a point $P: (x_{i},y_{i})$ to $D: (x_{j},y_{j})$, by taking the difference
between $x_i, x_j$ summed with the difference between $y_i, y_j$. Here, $x_j,y_j$ is 
the goal we are trying to reach, and $x_i, y_i$  is the current point of the A*
search.
The downside of the manhattan distance is that it does not circumfere obstacles.
Consider figure \autoref{fig:manhattansucks}
