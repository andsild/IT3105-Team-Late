Fall 2014 IT3105

Grades:
  Assignment 1: 33 / 35  A* works, but the repaint (backtracking) can fail in some cases  
             2:          GAC works smoothly)  
             
Assignment 3/4: 37 / 45 Nonograms worked in all cases, even the 'tough' case. One case, however, failed, for reasons beyond us.  
                        Flow puzzles work ISH. They fail the case where there is a path as follows:  
                      .  f . .  
                      .  f F .  
                      .  f f .  
                        
That is, a path coming from north and making a u-turn to the end-point (capital F)
